        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>My favorite book is called Calgar's Fury here is a picture of the cover:</p>
        <img src="https://www.blacklibrary.com/Images/Product/DefaultBL/xlarge/BLPROCESSED-Calgars-Fury-cover.jpg" id="img1">
        <p>It is as sci-fi book that is part of a huge series. Sometimes, I read for hours on end, and sometimes I don't read for a week in a row.</p>
        <h2>Doing Whatever I can do at That Time</h2>
        <p>I think the title explains it all. I do whatever I can do. I sometimes read, because reading is something you can't technically ALWAYS do, so that. This also includes geeking over UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE.</p>
